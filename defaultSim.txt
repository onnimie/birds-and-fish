Here is the default settings for the simulation. This file is loaded when then application is ran.

You can use this file as an example if you wish to alter, save or load a set of simulation settings.
There are four information types, each information needs to be on its own line. For the programme to be
able to read each information line, they must start with one of the following: POP, RUL, SPE or BOI.

Each of these information types that are POP, RUL, SPE or BOI contain information of the population,
a behaviour rule (there are 4 rules), simulation speed or a single boid, respectively.

Any line that doesn't start with these prefixes are ignored by the programme.
Whitespace is allowed everywhere, but each information type needs to contain all of its information on its one line.
Here are the formats for the information types, inputs are given where the parenthesis are:

# POP (population amount as an integer)
# RUL (name of the rule: Separation, Cohesion, Alignment or Randomization) ; (weight as an integer) ; (enabled as 1 or 0)
# SPE (simulation speed as a number with one decimal within the range of 0.1 and 20.0)

(you don't need to give any boids their starting position, they are randomized by default
 if you do give some boids initial values, the rest of the population are randomized)
a BOI-piece contains a boids inital xy-position and its direction as a 2d-vector

# BOI (x-position as a float), (y-position as a float) ; (x-vector as a float), (y-vector as a float)


here are the parameters for the default sim:

POP 231
RUL Separation; 29; 1
RUL Cohesion; 34; 1
RUL Alignment; 37; 1
RUL Randomization; 53; 1
SPE 2.3
BOI 928.85126,78.23431;-3.0450428,0.5811317
